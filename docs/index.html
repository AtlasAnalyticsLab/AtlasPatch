    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        Patch extraction from gigapixel whole-slide images, typically guided by tissue detection methods, forms the backbone of computational pathology workflows, 
        and remains a major computational bottleneck. Here we present AtlasPatch, an efficient and scalable slide preprocessing framework designed to enable accurate tissue 
        detection and high-throughput patch extraction with minimal computational overhead. To ensure robust and generalizable slide processing, we curated and 
        semi-manually annotated a diverse dataset of approximately 35,000 whole-slide image thumbnails spanning multiple cohorts, tissue types, and organ systems. Using this 
        corpus, we implement selective finetuning of the normalization layers of the Segment-Anything2 model for efficient thumbnail-level segmentation. This strategy ensures
        fast processing while achieving segmentation accuracy comparable to—or exceeding—that of existing methods. From the thumbnail masks, tissue coordinates are efficiently 
        extrapolated to full-resolution slides for precise patch extraction. The entire pipeline is parallelized for both CPU and GPU execution to maximize throughput. We assess 
        AtlasPatch across segmentation accuracy, computational complexity, and downstream multiple-instance learning performance, showing consistent predictive power with 
        state-of-the-art methods while operating at a fraction of their computational cost.
